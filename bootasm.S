# When the PC starts, the processor is essentially emulating an 8086 processor, i.e. 
# a 16-bit processor.  So our initial boot loader code is 16-bit code that will 
# eventually switch the processor into 32-bit mode.

# This code is linked to assume a starting address of 0x7C00 which is where the BIOS
# will load a boot segment.
